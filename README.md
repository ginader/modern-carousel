jQuery Carousel
===============

This is carousel script for jQuery that is configurable in a multitude of ways.

Modern
------

This carousel has been written with modern browsers in mind. By "modern", I mean any with a _reasonable_ support for CSS2. As a result, it won't style correctly in IE6 without a bit of hackery in the CSS files.

Demo
